# Privacy Policy for Tab Limit Extension

Last updated: 14th August 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Tab Limit Extension ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles information when you use our Chrome browser extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information Collection and Use

The Tab Limit Extension is designed to help users manage their browser tabs without collecting or processing any personal data. We want to be clear:

- We do not collect any personal information.
- We do not track your browsing history.
- We do not store any data on our servers.

## Local Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage API to save your preferences (such as the maximum number of tabs allowed). This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

## Permissions

Our extension requires certain permissions to function properly:

- `storage`: This permission is used to store your preferences locally.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the extension and do not involve data collection.

## Changes to User Settings

Any changes you make to the extension's settings are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted elsewhere.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services or analytics tools in our extension.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since we do not collect any user data, there is no data retention or deletion process. If you uninstall the extension, all locally stored preferences will be automatically removed from your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Open Source

The Tab Limit Extension is open-source software. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license. You can review the code to verify our privacy practices.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at the email address provided in the extension's Chrome Web Store listing.

## Consent

By using our extension, you consent to our Privacy Policy.
